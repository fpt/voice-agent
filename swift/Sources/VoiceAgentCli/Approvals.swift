/// Answers the backend's mutation-approval requests (file writes, shell
/// commands). voice-agent passes one of these to `agentNew`; without it the backend
/// is told to run autonomously and edits files with no gate — which is the bug
/// this fixes.
///
/// The same object serves every REPL mode; `mode` is flipped as the CLI moves
/// between them:
///
/// - `.prompt` (text REPL): print the request and block on a `y/a/n` answer read
///   from stdin. Safe here because a turn runs while the REPL loop is parked at
///   `await session.step`, so nothing else is reading stdin.
/// - `.deny` (voice REPL): refuse every mutation. Voice has no safe way to
///   confirm a file write by speech, and its libedit char-reader owns stdin, so
///   prompting would corrupt the input line. The user switches to text mode to
///   allow edits.
/// - `.allow` (one-shot `--prompt`): non-interactive, so grant automatically —
///   `--prompt` is the scripting path and there's no one to ask.
///
/// `approve` is invoked synchronously on a backend-servicing thread, so it must
/// be thread-safe and is expected to block until it returns a decision.
